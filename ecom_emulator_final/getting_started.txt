0) eth0 should be pluged into DHCP server, and eth1 into laptop for logging and SSH
1) Plug in power to gumstix on tobi-duo
2) make sure you can ping 172.16.1.14, if not, something is wrong with your conneciton to the gumstix
3) ssh into gumstix ssh root@ 172.16.1.14
4) first just try to get it running:
		 ./ecom_emulator_final/start_emulator.sh

   if that fails, try these:
4) Change MAC address in configure_emulator.sh
5) Change HPID in firewall.h, HAP_emulator.h ,modbus.py, webserver.py
6) Change interface in HAP_emualator.h ,modbus.py, webserver.py



#Troubleshooting:
1) if everything should be working but it is not, check to see if the MAC addresses are different between the two computers, the emulator changes the MAC to a default number, and if the emulator is started on the laptop and the Gumstix without changing the config file, the MACs will be the same!
2) lots of debugging options are available by setting the #define macros from 0 to 1 in HAP_emulator.h
3) if things aren't working from the start, or you are getting strange default values parsing files, suspect these paths, they are relative to where the progam is started from!
4) gumstix DHCP connection is supposed to default to 172.16.1.9 if no dhcp server is available, but this doesn't always work, when in doubt, plug eth0 into DHCP server
5) seems like the SSH does not like the USB/Ethernet jack, so SSH right from the build-in ethernet port
6) all else fails: robert.m.jaromin@gmail.com (no promises)

good luck!
